abstract={This paper studies a zero-sum state-feedback game for a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing one-seasonal dynamics of two biotrophic fungal cohorts within a common host plant. From the perspective of adaptive dynamics, the cohorts can be interpreted as resident and mutant populations. The invasion functional takes the form of the difference between the two marginal fitness criteria and represents the cost in the definition of the value of the differential game. The presence of a specific competition term in both equations and marginal fitnesses substantially complicates the reduction in the game to a two-step problem that can be solved by using optimal control theory. Therefore, a general game-theoretic formulation involving uninvadable strategies has to be considered. First, the related Cauchy problem for the Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs equation is investigated analytically by the method of characteristics. A number of important properties are rigorously derived. However, the complete theoretical analysis still remains an open challenging problem due to the high complexity of the differential game. That is why an ad hoc conjecture is additionally proposed. An informal but rather convincing and practical justification for the latter relies on numerical simulation results. We also establish some asymptotic properties and provide biological interpretations.},

    abstract = { Semi-discrete models are a particular class of hybrid dynamical systems that undergo continuous dynamics most of the time but repeatedly experience discrete changes at some given moments. In the life sciences, since the first semi-discrete model was derived to describe population dynamics by Beverton \&amp; Holt (Beverton \&amp; Holt 1957 In Fisheries investigations, series\&nbsp;2, vol. 19), a large body of literature has been concerned with such modelling approaches. The aim of the present contribution is twofold. On the one hand, it provides a comprehensive introduction to semi-discrete modelling through two illustrative examples: the classical work by Beverton and Holt is recalled and an original example on immigration in a population model affected by a strong Allee effect is worked out. On the other hand, a short overview of the different applications of semi-discrete models in the life sciences is proposed. }
